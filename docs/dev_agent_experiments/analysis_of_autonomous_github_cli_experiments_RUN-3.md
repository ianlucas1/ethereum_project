# Analysis of Autonomous GitHub CLI Experiments – Run 3 Report

## Executive Summary

In this third run of autonomous GitHub CLI experiments, the agent achieved a key milestone by inducing a **deliberate CI failure** and capturing its details. The agent added a failing unit test (an `assert False` in `tests/test_fail.py`), opened PR #120, and successfully observed multiple **failing CI checks** – notably identifying the failed “Python CI” test job and logging its name and URL. This confirmed the agent’s ability to detect a red CI status after struggling to produce one in Run 2. In parallel, the agent investigated **configuration drifts** in linting: it discovered that certain lint rules (flake8 line-length and Bandit’s assert-use) are configured differently in local pre-commit vs CI, explaining why earlier attempts to trigger failures were ineffective. The agent also noted a persistent **pre-commit hook issue** (Bandit) that blocked commits, which it bypassed using `--no-verify`. Throughout Run 3, the agent adhered to improved output hygiene guidelines – providing concise summaries and logging raw outputs to a file – resulting in clearer, more efficient interactions. Based on these findings, the experiment priority has been adjusted: **fixing the Bandit hook and aligning lint configs now take precedence** over further failure-handling tests. Looking ahead, the focus will shift to implementing those fixes (Experiments 3-11 and 3-10) and enhancing the agent’s autonomy in responding to CI outcomes (re-running failed jobs and extracting failure details) before attempting more complex end-to-end scenarios.

## CI & Lint Outcomes

**Failing Check Observed:** The agent successfully provoked a CI failure in Run 3. By pushing a branch with an intentional test failure and opening PR #120, it caused the repository’s GitHub Actions to report failing checks. The agent used `gh pr checks --watch` to monitor the PR and, upon completion, saw **“3 failing” checks** in the summary【18†】. It programmatically extracted the names and URLs of the failed checks, confirming for example the **“Python CI”** test workflow failed (as expected from the `assert False`) and recording its full URL. This fulfills the goal of capturing a failing check’s details; previously, the agent had never seen a non-green CI. The captured information (check name + URL) serves as proof that the agent can identify specific failing jobs autonomously.

**Lint Configuration Drift:** Run 3 reaffirmed that the local vs CI linting configurations were misaligned, which had led to confusion in Run 2. The agent found concrete evidence that: (a) **Flake8’s E501 (line length) rule is ignored in the repo’s config**, so CI will **never fail on long lines**; and (b) **Bandit in CI is set to severity “medium”**, meaning **low-severity issues like B101 (use of `assert`) are not treated as failures**. In other words, the CI static analysis job skips Bandit findings below medium severity. These discoveries explained why the agent’s earlier attempts to trigger CI failures with an overly long line or an `assert` statement didn’t work – those conditions were essentially being filtered out by config. The agent logged that its assumptions were “partially incorrect” because certain rules it thought would cause failures were intentionally ignored. Armed with this knowledge, the team can now adjust the configuration to synchronize local and CI behavior.

**Pre-Commit Hook Issue:** The agent encountered the Bandit **pre-commit hook failure** again in Run 3 when committing the failing test. As in Run 2, the pre-commit hook (configured to run `bandit -r . ...`) choked on receiving a specific file path, producing an *“unrecognized arguments: tests/test\_fail.py”* error. This is the known issue of Bandit’s `-r .` flag conflicting with file-specific arguments. The failed hook also revealed a flake8 warning (B011) for the `assert False`, but notably **the Bandit hook’s error aborted the commit**. The agent recognized what happened (“commit failed due to pre-commit hooks: … and `bandit` (arg parsing error)”) and proceeded to retry the commit with `--no-verify` (bypassing all hooks). The commit then succeeded, and the agent pushed the changes. While this workaround unblocked the experiment, it highlights a risk: the agent had to bypass quality checks to proceed. This **configuration bug in the Bandit hook** is slated to be fixed in an upcoming task (Experiment 3-11) since it undermines the usefulness of local pre-commit enforcement.

## Hygiene Rule Observations

**Improved Output Discipline:** In Run 3, the agent significantly improved its adherence to the “hygiene” guidelines set after Run 2. It adopted a pattern of providing **mini-summaries** at the end of each major task, condensing the results into 1–3 sentences. These summaries allowed the agent to clear out verbose details from its active context (a basic token guard strategy) while preserving key information for the log. The agent also **avoided dumping raw command output in the chat**. Instead, it logged detailed outputs to the `github_cli_execution_log.md` file, following the structured format (commands, raw output, analysis) established earlier. For example, when querying CI statuses and encountering lengthy JSON or multi-line outputs, the agent either summarized the result or explicitly wrote the full output to the log file, keeping the conversation itself concise. This chunking of logs made the interactive dialogue easier to follow and prevented excessive token consumption.

**Remaining Verbosity:** While output formatting was much cleaner, there were still a few **minor verbosity issues** in the agent’s reasoning process. The agent sometimes narrated its steps in great detail (first-person descriptions of each sub-step), which, while not as problematic as raw logs, could be trimmed in the future for brevity. Additionally, the agent occasionally performed **redundant actions** – for instance, to detect the CI failure on PR #120 it used both the `gh pr checks` CLI output and a GitHub API call in succession, essentially retrieving the same information twice. This double-checking did ensure accuracy, but it was a manual redundancy that cost time. There were also moments where the agent could perhaps have provided an intermediate summary of a long reasoning chain, rather than only at the end. Overall, however, these gaps were relatively small and did not significantly hinder the outcome. The hygiene measures introduced after Run 2 (terse outputs, summaries, log file usage) proved effective in Run 3, resulting in a far more streamlined interaction.

## Root-Cause vs Fix Matrix for Lint Config Drift (Bandit/Flake8)

To address the discovered inconsistencies between local and CI linting, we tabulate the root causes and potential fixes for each issue:

| **Drift Issue**                    | **Root Cause** (Current Behavior)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Proposed Fix** (Alignment Strategy)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Flake8 E501 not enforced*         | CI’s lint config explicitly **ignores E501** (line-length), so long lines never trigger failure. Meanwhile, local flake8 (if run without the pre-commit settings) might flag long lines. This mismatch misled the agent when it tried to induce a failure via a long line.                                   | Remove E501 from the ignore list in the config so that both local and CI lint will flag long lines. Alternatively, set a consistent `--max-line-length` in both environments and enforce it (e.g. 88 chars) so that any true violation is caught everywhere.                                                                             |
| *Bandit B101 (assert) not failing* | The **CI runs Bandit with `--severity-level medium`**, which **skips low-severity issues like B101**. Thus, an `assert` usage yields a warning but not a failed check. Locally, the pre-commit Bandit (when run manually) might flag it, but CI will always pass.                                            | Configure CI to catch `assert` usage as an error: for example, run Bandit at severity “low” or do not filter out B101. If B101 should be considered a breaking issue, align the severity level accordingly. Otherwise, at least document this behavior so the agent knows an assert won’t break CI.                                      |
| *Bandit pre-commit hook failure*   | The pre-commit hook is set to run **`bandit -r .`** (scan entire repo) regardless of file changes. When specific files are passed by pre-commit, this leads to **“unrecognized arguments”** (Bandit can’t take both `-r .` and file paths) and thus the hook errors out every time a new file is introduced. | Modify the Bandit hook configuration to **remove the `-r .` argument**, allowing Bandit to only scan the files passed by pre-commit. This way it will analyze the staged files normally and not conflict with provided paths. (Alternatively, adjust the hook to use a `--path` argument if needed, but removing recursion is simplest.) |

By implementing these fixes, the linting behavior will be consistent across local development and CI. This should prevent the agent from being confused by discrepancies (e.g., expecting a CI failure that never occurs) and also remove the need to bypass broken hooks.

## Updated Risks & Limitations

The findings from Run 3 refine our understanding of the system’s risks and limitations. In addition to those noted in Run 2, we add new ones regarding hook bypass and log analysis:

* **CI–Lint Config Mismatch (Flake8 E501):** Inconsistent lint rules between local and CI can mislead the agent. For example, flake8 rule E501 (line length) is ignored in the CI’s config, so the agent might incorrectly believe a long line will fail CI when it actually won’t. Such divergence in config is a risk for autonomous reasoning about “what will make CI red.” Aligning these configurations is important to avoid false assumptions.
* **Bandit Low-Severity Issues Not Flagged:** The agent learned that some security linter issues (like Bandit’s B101) are not treated as failures in CI due to severity filtering. A “passing” CI doesn’t mean absence of security warnings – it just means none of the high/medium severity rules failed. This limitation risks the agent thinking a potentially problematic pattern (like use of `assert`) is acceptable since CI passed it. The agent must be aware that **CI success can still contain low-severity warnings** that might merit attention outside the strict pass/fail criteria.
* **Pre-Commit Hook Bypass Risk:** To overcome the Bandit hook error, the agent resorted to `git commit --no-verify`, bypassing all pre-commit checks. This is risky because it allows code changes to skip local quality gates (formatting, lint, security checks) and only be caught (if at all) by later CI. If the agent over-relies on hook bypass, it could introduce changes that violate project standards or even fail CI, defeating the purpose of those hooks. This risk will persist until the underlying hook issue is fixed – the agent should ideally only bypass hooks sparingly and prefer to resolve the cause of hook failures.
* **No Automated Log-Scraping for Failed Jobs:** Currently, when a CI job fails, the agent **identifies the failing check’s name and URL but does not retrieve the log contents**. There is no autonomous mechanism to open the failure logs (e.g. the Actions job page or artifacts) to extract the error message or stack trace. For instance, in Run 3 the agent logged the failing test’s URL but did not delve into the log output of that test run. This lack of “log scraping” means the agent cannot yet diagnose *why* a job failed – it knows *which* job failed but not the details of the failure. This is a significant limitation for self-healing: the agent would need to parse logs to suggest or attempt fixes without human guidance. (We anticipate addressing this in a future experiment focused on retrieving and analyzing CI logs.)

## Re-ranked Experiment Priorities (Descending)

Based on the Run 3 outcomes, we have updated the priority of upcoming experiments. The next runs will tackle configuration fixes before proceeding to further CI failure-handling and autonomy enhancements. The new priority order is:

1. **Fix Bandit hook (Experiment 3-11):** Resolve the Bandit pre-commit hook argument issue so that commits are no longer blocked or require `--no-verify`. This involves editing the hook configuration (likely in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) to remove or alter the problematic `-r .` usage.
2. **Align lint config (Experiment 3-10):** Investigate and reconcile differences between local and CI linting setups. The agent will adjust configurations for Flake8 and Bandit to ensure that both environments enforce the same rules (e.g., consistent line-length limits and handling of Bandit B101) and then validate that the changes produce the expected behavior (CI fails when it should).
3. **Re-run failed checks (Experiment 3-8):** Implement the ability to automatically re-run failed CI jobs on a PR. Now that the agent can detect a failing check, the next step is to have it invoke `gh run rerun` (or the equivalent API) for those failed runs. This will test the agent’s capacity to recover from failures by triggering CI to re-run (useful for flaky tests or after potential fixes).
4. **Branch-protection merge-block test (Experiment 3-9):** Attempt to merge a PR that has failing checks to see how the agent and GitHub respond. This will likely be blocked by branch protection rules. The agent needs to interpret the error and understand that merges are prevented until checks pass. This experiment will verify the agent’s behavior when it tries an action that repository settings forbid (an important safeguard to observe).
5. **Log-scraping POC (Experiment 4-11):** Prototype a method for the agent to fetch and parse CI log contents when a job fails. Currently planned as part of Experiment Set 4, this would involve using the URLs of failed checks (from GitHub’s API or CLI) to retrieve the raw logs and scanning them for error clues. Success in this experiment would greatly enhance the agent’s autonomous debugging abilities, enabling it to identify specific failure reasons (e.g. test assertion messages or lint errors) without human intervention.

*(The numbering above corresponds to experiment IDs in the project plan. Higher-priority items will be tackled first in the next run.)*

## CoT Inefficiencies and Optimization Suggestions

**Observed Inefficiencies:** During Run 3, a few inefficiencies in the agent’s chain-of-thought (CoT) execution became apparent. One notable issue was **long polling**: the agent used `gh pr checks --watch` to wait for CI results, which meant it sat idle for several minutes until all jobs completed. This straightforward approach worked, but it tied up the agent in a blocking wait. Additionally, as mentioned, the agent sometimes performed **duplicate work** – for example, simultaneously polling via CLI and via a REST API call for check statuses – to ensure it didn’t miss anything. While thorough, this redundancy in status checks could be streamlined. Another inefficiency is that after observing a failure, the agent did not proactively attempt any corrective action or rerun within the same run. It identified the failure and then essentially stopped (awaiting the next instructed experiment to handle re-runs or fixes). In a truly autonomous scenario, the agent should ideally respond to a failure by at least exploring a retry or fix immediately.

**Suggested Optimizations:** We recommend a few optimizations to make the agent’s workflow more efficient and autonomous in future runs:

* **Smarter Polling:** Instead of using a blocking `--watch`, the agent could employ a loop with periodic checks using the GitHub API. For instance, it could query the check-run statuses every minute and then sleep, which would free the conversation from constant output and allow monitoring without tying up the session. The agent could also leverage shorter watch intervals or background threads (if available) to reduce idle time. In later experiment designs, a multi-model approach is considered (using a lightweight model to wait/poll, as per Experiment Set 6) to avoid consuming expensive tokens on waiting. These approaches would make CI monitoring more time-efficient.

* **Single Source of Truth for Status:** The agent should choose either the CLI or the API for a given information query, rather than both. Using **structured data from the GitHub API** is likely more robust for parsing outcomes. For example, the agent can directly fetch the JSON of check runs or workflow runs and inspect the `conclusion` fields, which is less error-prone than scraping terminal text. Relying on one method (preferably the API JSON) would simplify the logic and reduce redundant steps.

* **Agent-Level Retry Logic:** When a failing check is detected, the agent could automatically attempt a **retry of that check** if appropriate. The project plan already includes Experiment 3-8 to test `gh run rerun` functionality; incorporating that behavior, the agent itself could, upon seeing a failure, issue a rerun command for the failed workflow without waiting for human instruction. Of course, this should be done judiciously (perhaps only once, to avoid infinite loops), but it would demonstrate a higher degree of autonomy – the agent not only notices a failure but also takes a step to resolve it (in cases of flaky or transient failures).

* **Early Failure Detection:** The agent could improve how quickly it recognizes a failing state. Instead of waiting for all checks to complete, if one check fails early, the agent might note it and decide whether to continue waiting or act. Currently, the agent waited for the full suite to finish (since `--watch` runs to completion). A more advanced strategy could be: if a critical check fails, record it immediately and consider initiating a fix or notifying that the PR cannot be merged, without necessarily waiting for other jobs (which might be dependent or will be skipped due to the failure). This requires careful coordination to avoid false positives, but it can speed up reaction time.

Implementing these optimizations will make the agent’s CoT execution loop more **efficient and resilient**. By reducing unnecessary waiting and duplication, and by adding a degree of self-driven error recovery, the agent moves closer to true autonomy in managing the PR workflow from start to finish.
