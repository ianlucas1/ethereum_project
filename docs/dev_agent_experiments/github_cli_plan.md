# GitHub CLI Experimentation Plan
*(updated 2025-05-11 after Run 4; Per-Run Log strategy note added)*

This roadmap tracks experiments that probe an LLM Agent's ability to manage a GitHub repository autonomously via the **`gh` CLI** (and, where needed, raw GitHub API calls). The Agent's actions, outputs, and learnings are recorded in separate log files for each experimental run (e.g., `github_cli_execution_log_RUN_X.md`).

## Experiment Set 3 â€” Reacting to Check Statuses  âœ… (Completed in Run 4)

*3-8* **Re-run failed CI checks** â€” implemented in Run 4 (PR #120, run-id 14957856078).  
*3-9* **Merge with failing checks** â€” Triggered in Run 5. Block detected & logged. **Done (Run 5)**

---

## Experiment Set 4 â€” Information Extraction from Failed Checks

*4-10* **Extract failing-check URLs** â€” baseline (`gh pr checks`).  
*4-11* **Fetch & summarise CI logs** â€” use `gh run view <id> --log`; write 5-line summary into execution log. **Done (Run 5)**

---

## **Experiment Set 5 â€” Merge-Queue & Conflict Handling**  ðŸ”¥

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| **5-1** | *Detect merge-queue block* | Agent to open PR, then Human Collaborator advances `main`; Agent must notice GitHub's "out of date" / "needs update" message on the PR. |
| **5-2** | *Auto-rebase & re-push* | Agent rebases PR branch onto fresh `main`, force-pushes, watches CI re-run, merges when green. |

---

## **Experiment Set 6 â€” Automatic Remediation Loop**  ðŸ”¥

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 6-1 | *Failing test already in repo* (2-5b) | PR #120 serves as the red baseline. |
| 6-2a | *Generate minimal fix* | Agent proposes a patch that makes the failing test in PR #120 pass. |
| 6-2b | *Apply fix & verify* | Agent applies patch to PR #120's branch, pushes fix, ensures CI green, sets auto-merge, branch deletes. |

---

## Experiment Set 7 â€” Secret-Scanning Push-Protection  â—»ï¸Ž Low

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 7-1 | *Intentionally push dummy secret* | Agent attempts to push a commit containing a dummy secret, triggering server-side rejection. |
| 7-2 | *Auto-redact & re-push* | Agent identifies the problematic commit/file, removes/redacts the secret, amends the commit, and pushes successfully. |

---

## Experiment Set 8 â€” Dependency-Update Autopilot  â—¼ï¸Ž Medium

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 8-1 | *Poll Dependabot PRs* | Agent uses `gh pr list` or API calls to detect open PRs authored by Dependabot. |
| 8-2 | *Merge if green / open issue if red* | If Dependabot PR has all green checks, Agent merges it. If checks are red, Agent opens a GitHub issue detailing the failure. |

---

## **Experiment Set 9 â€” Context-Window Self-Management**  âœ… (Completed in Run 5)

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 9-1 | *Token-count monitor* | Agent logs CoT token size; when > 30 k, writes recap & truncates scratchpad. **Done (Run 5, Conceptual)** |

---

## **Experiment Set 10 â€” CI Artifact Retrieval & Log Consumption**  ðŸ”¥ (Partially Done)

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 10-1 | *Fetch log for failed job* | Agent uses `gh run view <id> --log` to retrieve logs for a specific failed job. **Done (Run 5, via Exp 4-11)** |
| 10-2 | *Summarise traceback* | Agent provides a natural-language 5-line summary of the key error/traceback from the fetched log. **Done (Run 5, via Exp 4-11)** |
| 10-3 | *Tag failure class* | Agent attempts to categorize the failure: Code Bug Â· Config Issue Â· Infrastructure Flake Â· Test Flakiness. |

---

## **Experiment Set 11 â€” Multi-PR Queue Awareness**  â—¼ï¸Ž Medium

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 11-1 | *List self-authored PRs* | Agent uses `gh pr list --author "@me"` to list its own open PRs. |
| 11-2 | *Cancel or update conflicting PR* | If Agent creates a new PR that conflicts with one of its existing open PRs, it should identify the conflict and either close the old PR or update it to resolve the conflict. |

---

## Experiment Set 12 â€” Custom Pre-commit Hooks & CI Policies for Repo Hygiene âœ… (Completed in Run 6)

| ID    | Focus                                              | Priority | Status           |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|
| 12-1  | Add pre-commit hook to limit staged files (<25)      | â—¼ï¸Ž Med   | **Done (Run 6)** |
| 12-2  | Add CI check for push frequency (>5 commits)         | â—¼ï¸Ž Med   | **Done (Run 6)** |
| 12-3  | Refine README hygiene rules (log first, final sync)  | â—¼ï¸Ž Med   | **Done (Run 6)** |

## Back-burner Sets (no change)

*Set 5 (old)* â€” Diff-First workflow (JSON-only decision loop)  
*Set 6 (old)* â€” Model-swap efficiency study

### Time-Boxing Rule (unchanged)

> **20 minutes wall-clock or 3 hard failures â†’ Agent logs attempts, marks "Partially Complete", moves to next experiment.**

### Hygiene Rule (unchanged)

*   Mini-summaries, chunked logs by Agent.
*   Raw stdout/stderr goes into the active `github_cli_execution_log_*.md` file, not chat.
*   **No 4,000-token pause** â€” Agent must run uninterrupted, managing its own context if necessary (see Exp 9-1).
*   **Regular Integration (Log First!):** Changes related to experiments or their documentation (plan, log, README updates) MUST be logged by the Agent to the active `github_cli_execution_log_*.md` *before* being committed. The full cycle is: Experiment Actions -> Log Updates -> Commit (passing hooks) -> Push -> PR -> CI -> Merge -> Local Cleanup. This avoids out-of-sync logs and large, problematic change accumulations.
*   **Final Action of a Run (Log First!):** Before concluding a run, the Agent ensures all documentation is updated and all changes are pushed, merged via PR, and local git is tidied.

Refer to `docs/dev_agent_experiments/README.md` for the complete "Context-Hygiene Rules for the LLM Agent".

---

### Log File Management (Per-Run Logs)

To keep log files manageable, each distinct experimental "Run" by the Agent will typically use a new, uniquely named log file (e.g., `github_cli_execution_log_RUN_X.md`). The active log file for a given run will be confirmed at the start of that run. Refer to the main `README.md` for a complete list of hygiene rules.
