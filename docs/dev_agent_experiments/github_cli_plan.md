# GitHub CLI Experimentation Plan  
*(updated 2025-05-11 after Run 4)*

This roadmap tracks experiments that probe an LLM agent's ability to manage a GitHub repository autonomously via the **`gh` CLI** (and, where needed, raw GitHub API calls).

## Experiment Set 3 â€” Reacting to Check Statuses  âœ… (Completed in Run 4)

*3-8* **Re-run failed CI checks** â€” implemented in Run 4 (PR #120, run-id 14957856078).  
*3-9* **Merge with failing checks** â€” Triggered in Run 5. Block detected & logged. **Done (Run 5)**

---

## Experiment Set 4 â€” Information Extraction from Failed Checks

*4-10* **Extract failing-check URLs** â€” baseline (`gh pr checks`).  
*4-11* **Fetch & summarise CI logs** â€” use `gh run view <id> --log`; write 5-line summary into execution log. **Done (Run 5)**

---

## **Experiment Set 5 â€” Merge-Queue & Conflict Handling**  ðŸ”¥

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| **5-1** | *Detect merge-queue block* | Open PR, then advance `main`; agent must notice GitHub's "out of date" / "needs update" message. |
| **5-2** | *Auto-rebase & re-push* | Agent rebases onto fresh `main`, force-pushes, watches CI re-run, merges when green. |

---

## **Experiment Set 6 â€” Automatic Remediation Loop**  ðŸ”¥

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 6-1 | *Failing test already in repo* (2-5b) | PR #120 serves as the red baseline. |
| 6-2a | *Generate minimal fix* | Agent proposes a patch that makes the failing test pass. |
| 6-2b | *Apply fix & verify* | Push fix, ensure CI green, set auto-merge, branch deletes. |

---

## Experiment Set 7 â€” Secret-Scanning Push-Protection  â—»ï¸Ž Low

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 7-1 | *Intentionally push dummy secret* | Trigger server-side rejection. |
| 7-2 | *Auto-redact & re-push* | Agent removes secret, recommits, pushes successfully. |

---

## Experiment Set 8 â€” Dependency-Update Autopilot  â—¼ï¸Ž Medium

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 8-1 | *Poll Dependabot PRs* | Detect open dependency PRs. |
| 8-2 | *Merge if green / open issue if red* | Close the loop on routine updates. |

---

## **Experiment Set 9 â€” Context-Window Self-Management**  â—¼ï¸Ž Med+

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 9-1 | *Token-count monitor* | Log CoT token size; when > 30 k, write recap & truncate scratchpad. **Done (Run 5, Conceptual)** |

---

## **Experiment Set 10 â€” CI Artifact Retrieval**  ðŸ”¥

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 10-1 | *Fetch log for failed job* | `gh run view <id> --log` **Done (Run 5)** |
| 10-2 | *Summarise traceback* | Natural-language 5-line summary. **Done (Run 5)** |
| 10-3 | *Tag failure class* | Code Â· Config Â· Infra Â· Flaky |

---

## **Experiment Set 11 â€” Multi-PR Queue Awareness**  â—¼ï¸Ž Medium

| ID | Step | Goal |
|----|------|------|
| 11-1 | *List self-authored PRs* | `gh pr list --author` |
| 11-2 | *Cancel or update conflicting PR* | Avoid overlapping edits. |

---

## Back-burner Sets (no change)

*Set 5 (old)* â€” Diff-First workflow (JSON-only decision loop)  
*Set 6 (old)* â€” Model-swap efficiency study

---

### Time-Boxing Rule (unchanged)

> **20 minutes wall-clock or 3 hard failures â†’ log attempts, mark "Partially Complete", move to next experiment.**

### Hygiene Rule (unchanged)

* Mini-summaries, chunked logs  
* Raw stdout/stderr goes into `github_cli_execution_log.md`  
* **No 4 000-token pause** â€” Agent must run uninterrupted.
* **Regular Integration:** Changes related to experiments or their documentation (plan, log, README updates) should be integrated frequently via a full PR cycle (branch, commit with passing hooks, push, PR, CI checks, merge, local cleanup). This avoids large, problematic accumulations of changes.
