Thank you for the detailed guidance. I will now prepare a tightly integrated analysis of Experiments 0.1–0.10, followed by forward-looking, autonomy-focused recommendations for the remaining `github_cli_plan.md` experiments. I’ll emphasize strategies to improve the Agent LLM’s ability to operate independently in non-interactive environments and reason about CI outcomes reliably. I’ll begin with an executive summary for clarity and decision-making support. I’ll let you know when the report is ready for your review.


# Analysis of Autonomous GitHub CLI Experiments and Future Strategy

## Executive Summary

1. **End-to-End PR Workflow Feasibility:** The LLM agent successfully executed core Git and GitHub CLI steps (branch creation, commit, push, PR creation, merge) autonomously, demonstrating that a full PR lifecycle can be automated. This provides a foundation to build on for more complex workflows and edge cases.

2. **Non-Interactive CLI Output Issues:** A critical limitation encountered was the GitHub CLI’s pager interfering with output in a headless environment. For example, `gh api` and `gh pr checks` commands returned errors instead of data due to paging (`head: |: No such file or directory`). **Recommendation:** Disable or bypass CLI pagination (e.g. setting a `GH_PAGER` environment variable to `cat` or using `--no-pager` options if available) and prefer CLI options that produce direct, parseable output (JSON or succinct text) to ensure the agent can capture information without a TTY.

3. **CI Status Retrieval and Autonomy:** The agent could not directly obtain CI check results via `gh pr checks` due to the above issue, requiring a workaround (`--watch`) and human assistance. **Recommendation:** Implement a robust method for fetching PR check statuses autonomously – for instance, using `gh pr checks --watch` with the agent capturing final output or calling GitHub APIs for check runs. This will enable the agent to know when checks pass or fail without human intervention, a prerequisite for safe auto-merging.

4. **Effective PR Merging and Cleanup:** Using `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` the agent merged the PR and cleaned up both local and remote branches in one step. This success shows the agent can finalize a PR efficiently. **Recommendation:** Continue leveraging this one-command merge & cleanup in future workflows, while ensuring any preconditions (all checks passed, required reviews) are met. The agent should verify branch protection rules or configure the repository to allow it to merge autonomously (e.g. temporarily relaxing required reviews or using code owners it controls).

5. **Next Experiment Priorities:** Future tests should focus on failure handling and advanced PR states. Key areas include how the agent handles failing CI checks (detecting failures, re-running workflows, or declining to merge) and understanding PR metadata (draft status, reviewers, labels). **Recommendation:** Prioritize experiments on re-running failed checks and parsing failure output (to guide auto-fixes), as well as recognizing draft PRs and reviewer requirements so the agent doesn’t attempt actions (like merging) when not appropriate. Less critical enhancements like adding labels or reviewers via CLI can be tested after reliability in the core PR pipeline is achieved.

## Branch Creation (Git Experiment 0.2)

**Analysis:** The agent successfully created a new Git branch using `git checkout -b`. The CLI output “Switched to a new branch…” confirmed the operation, and the agent correctly interpreted this as success. This demonstrates the agent’s ability to isolate work on feature branches, which is essential for managing parallel changes and proper PR workflows. No issues were encountered in this step – the command ran in a non-interactive environment without requiring additional flags, and the agent’s reasoning to use a clear branch name (`experiment/test-pr-workflow-0`) shows foresight in naming conventions.

**Recommendation:** The straightforward success of branch creation indicates this capability is solid. Going forward, the agent should consistently create uniquely named branches for each task/PR to avoid conflicts. As an enhancement, the agent could implement a naming scheme (including maybe ticket IDs or timestamps) to ensure branch names are unique and descriptive. Additionally, the agent might check for existing branch names before creation (e.g., using `git branch` or `gh branch list`) to avoid collisions, though in this controlled experiment it wasn’t an issue. With branch creation working, the agent can confidently branch off for new changes as the first step of autonomous workflows.

## Staging Changes (Git Experiment 0.3)

**Analysis:** The agent staged file changes with `git add` successfully. As expected, `git add` produced no console output on success, which the agent correctly interpreted as a silent success (the log explicitly notes “no output…which is expected on success”). This indicates the agent understands that certain Git commands will not provide feedback when they work, and the absence of errors means the operation succeeded. Staging is a trivial step, but it’s a prerequisite for committing – the agent performed it without confusion.

**Recommendation:** Given that staging succeeded without issues, the main recommendation is to maintain this correct interpretation of silent outputs. The agent should continue to handle commands that lack output by checking the exit status (which it implicitly did) and proceeding if no error is detected. For future robustness, if the agent were to stage multiple files or use patterns (e.g., `git add .`), it should be cautious of any unexpected stdout/stderr (like warnings for large files or end-of-line normalization messages) and treat those appropriately. Overall, no major changes are needed here – this capability is reliable.

## Committing Changes (Git Experiment 0.4)

**Analysis:** The agent committed the staged changes with `git commit -m "..."` and succeeded in creating a new commit. The output shows that repository hooks (like linting and checks configured via pre-commit) ran automatically: tools such as Ruff, Black, Flake8, etc., were invoked and mostly skipped (since the changed file wasn’t relevant to them), and Codespell passed. The commit was made on the new branch with a message indicating the experimental change. The agent’s post-action analysis recognized that these hook messages were normal and that the commit was created (noting the commit hash). This shows the agent can handle commit-time quality checks and interpret their output correctly, which is important in real projects where a failed hook would prevent a commit.

**Recommendation:** The agent should continue to use clear, descriptive commit messages (as it did, prefixing with `feat:` and describing the change) to maintain good repository hygiene. In future runs, if a pre-commit hook were to fail (e.g., a linter error), the agent must detect that the commit didn’t complete and react (perhaps by fixing formatting or adjusting its changes). Thus, a recommended future experiment is intentionally triggering a failing pre-commit hook to see if the agent can catch and resolve it. For now, since committing works, the agent can automate this step confidently. It’s also advisable that the agent ensures the author identity is configured (to avoid any prompts or misattributed commits); in these experiments, presumably the environment was already configured with user name and email, which should be a precondition for autonomous commits.

## Pushing Branch to Remote (Git Experiment 0.5)

**Analysis:** The agent pushed the new branch to the remote repository using `git push origin <branch>` without issues. The output logs show the Git push succeeded (object count, delta compression, etc.) and includes the helpful GitHub hint: “Create a pull request for ‘experiment/test-pr-workflow-0’… by visiting: \[GitHub URL]”. The agent noted that the URL for creating a PR was provided in the output. This confirms the agent’s networking and authentication were correctly set up (no credential prompts or permission errors), and it can push commits to GitHub. The presence of the PR suggestion URL in the output was parsed by the agent as useful context rather than an error, which is good.

**Recommendation:** Ensure the agent’s environment always has Git credentials or tokens configured so that pushes do not become interactive (no username/password prompts). In these experiments it was successful, likely using a pre-authenticated GitHub CLI context or an SSH key. The agent could take advantage of the push output: although in this case it proceeded to use `gh pr create`, the push’s suggestion could be used as a sanity check (e.g., verifying the branch exists on remote or using the URL if `gh pr create` was not an option). In future workflows, pushing is a point where things can fail (network issues, permissions, large file filters, etc.), so the agent should continue to verify the push output for success. Now that push is confirmed to work, the next focus is on what to do after the push – which is PR creation.

## Pull Request Creation (GitHub CLI Experiment 0.6)

**Analysis:** The agent created a pull request using `gh pr create` with a title, body, base, and head specified. This command executed non-interactively by providing all required parameters (thus avoiding the interactive editor prompt that `gh pr create` can invoke if no title/body given). The output confirms a PR was opened: “Creating pull request for experiment/test-pr-workflow-0 into main… URL: [https://github.com/ianlucas1/ethereum\_project/pull/112”\:contentReference\[oaicite:12\]{index=12}](https://github.com/ianlucas1/ethereum_project/pull/112”:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}). The agent correctly captured the PR URL and number. This shows the agent can initiate the PR step of the lifecycle autonomously. No errors were encountered (e.g., the agent had permission to create the PR, and the branch was pushed, so `gh` found it). The PR was created as a normal (not draft) PR.

**Analysis of Capability:** Successfully creating a PR means the agent can move from local changes to a GitHub-hosted review workflow under its own control. This unlocks the ability for the agent to subsequently query PR status, add metadata, and eventually merge – effectively allowing end-to-end software changes without human initiation.

**Recommendation:** In future experiments, expand the PR creation step to include additional metadata to test the agent’s handling of more complex scenarios:

* **Reviewers and Labels:** The next planned test is to use `gh pr create` with `--reviewer` and `--label` flags. The agent should attempt this to see if it can parse the outcome (e.g., confirming the PR has those reviewers/labels via `gh pr view`). This is not critical for autonomous operation (since an agent might operate without reviewers in a fully autonomous scenario), but it is useful for mixed workflows where human oversight is involved.
* **Draft PRs:** Another variation is creating a PR as a draft (`--draft`). This will test if the agent recognizes a draft PR cannot be merged until marked ready. We recommend conducting that experiment and ensuring the agent, upon seeing a draft status, knows to either convert it to ready (via CLI or API) or wait for a signal before merging.
* **Error handling:** The agent should also handle cases where `gh pr create` might fail (for example, if a PR already exists for that branch, or if the branch is behind `main` and repository rules prevent the PR). While those didn’t occur here, the agent could use `gh pr list` or `gh pr view` to check if a PR exists before creating a duplicate.

Overall, PR creation is working well. The agent can now programmatically initiate code review processes. The focus should now shift to what the agent does once a PR exists – specifically, monitoring CI checks and managing the PR to completion.

## PR Check Inspection (GitHub CLI Experiment 0.7 series)

**Analysis:** Checking the status of CI checks on the PR proved to be challenging due to the CLI’s behavior in a non-interactive setting. The agent first attempted `gh pr checks 112` to get the status of PR #112. This resulted in an error output with no status information: `head: |: No such file or directory` (and similarly for `cat`). Initially, when checks were still running, this command even produced a non-zero exit code (exit code 8 as noted in the logs) indicating an error. Even after all checks passed, re-running `gh pr checks 112` still produced the same pager-related error (though with exit code 0) and no useful output. These outcomes illustrate a limitation: the `gh pr checks` command tries to page output (or did not detect the environment properly), making it unreliable for the agent. The agent recognized this as a systemic issue, not just a transient failure, noting that the command was “consistently unreliable… due to pager issues”.

To overcome this, the agent tried an alternative: `gh pr checks --watch --interval 10`. By running this with the help of a background process (and the human collaborator capturing the output), the agent obtained the complete checks result: “All checks were successful” with a list of 11 successful checks and 1 skipped. This confirmed the PR’s CI was green. The agent learned that the `--watch` flag, which streams results and terminates after completion, bypassed the paging problem in this scenario. Essentially, using `--watch` allowed the CLI to continuously output until done, at which point the final state was printed and caught.

**Analysis of Limitation:** The need for human assistance to capture `--watch` output shows the agent’s current limitation in handling streaming output on its own. Also, the direct use of `gh pr checks` (without watch) is not feasible in the agent’s environment. This is a critical gap because understanding CI status is necessary before merging.

**Recommendation:** The agent’s approach to retrieving PR check status must be made robust and fully autonomous:

* The simplest fix for the pager issue is to configure the environment to disable pagination. For example, setting an environment variable `PAGER` or `GH_PAGER` to `cat` (or an empty string) would force `gh` to output directly to stdout without invoking a pager. This could allow `gh pr checks <PR>` to work as intended. We recommend updating the agent’s execution environment with this configuration for all CLI calls.
* Alternatively (or additionally), use the `gh` CLI’s JSON output capabilities. While `gh pr checks` doesn’t have a `--json` flag, the agent can query checks via the GitHub API. For example, it could run: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<commit_sha>/check-runs --jq '.check_runs'` to directly fetch the check runs associated with the PR’s latest commit. This would return structured data (names, statuses, conclusions, URLs) that the agent can parse, bypassing any formatting issues. We recommend adding such an approach as a fallback: if `gh pr checks` fails or if the environment is headless, use the API to get statuses.
* For real-time monitoring, since streaming is problematic, the agent can implement a polling mechanism. Instead of `--watch`, the agent could periodically call the above API or `gh pr checks` (if paging is disabled) until all checks report a final state. This avoids needing a background task with captured output. Experiment 0.7b already simulated this by effectively waiting; moving forward, the agent can automate the polling with a short sleep or loop in its reasoning cycle.
* Once the check information is reliably obtained, the agent should clearly interpret it. In these experiments, all checks were successful. In the future, when some checks fail (planned Experiment 5), the agent will need to parse which checks failed and possibly retrieve their URLs or details. Ensuring the output format is machine-friendly (via JSON or consistent text parse) will be crucial. We advise prioritizing an experiment where a PR has a failing check, so the agent can practice extracting the names of failing checks and their URLs (as outlined in the plan’s Experiment 10).

In summary, **resolving the CI check visibility issue is one of the highest priorities**. The agent should modify its strategy to either configure `gh` for non-interactive use or use alternate commands so it can autonomously decide if a PR is merge-ready or needs intervention.

## Pull Request Merging (GitHub CLI Experiment 0.8)

**Analysis:** The agent merged the pull request using `gh pr merge 112 --squash --delete-branch`, which succeeded and performed multiple actions in one go. The CLI output indicates:

* The PR was squashed and merged into the target branch (main).
* The local repository pulled the changes (fast-forwarded main).
* The local feature branch was deleted and the agent’s Git HEAD moved to `main`.
* The remote feature branch was also deleted.

This outcome demonstrates that the agent can finalize a PR without manual steps: the PR is closed and the repository cleaned up. Using `--squash` kept the commit history linear (which is often desired in projects), and `--delete-branch` took care of cleanup. The agent’s analysis noted that this single command “handled the merge and significant parts of the cleanup” and that it was executed successfully.

It’s worth noting that `gh pr merge` often prompts for confirmation in interactive mode. The fact it completed here suggests that in a non-interactive environment (or with those flags), it proceeded without prompting. This is good for automation, but we should verify if an implicit `--confirm` was assumed. It appears that providing the merge method (squash) and the branch deletion flag was enough to skip confirmation.

**Recommendation:** The agent should continue to use `gh pr merge` with appropriate flags to automate merges. A few considerations and improvements for future merges:

* **Branch Protection & Checks:** Ensure that all required conditions are met before merging. In this experiment, all checks passed and there were no required reviewers. In a typical scenario, if branch protection requires an approved review or all checks, `gh pr merge` would refuse to merge (or the merge would fail). The agent should either verify branch protection settings ahead of time or handle a merge failure gracefully. For instance, if a merge is blocked, the agent could output a message or attempt to address the block (like tagging a reviewer or waiting for checks). An earlier initial setup attempt tried to fetch protection rules (which returned nothing, implying no strict protections) – it might be wise to formally incorporate checking `gh api ...branches/main/protection` (with a pager fix) at the start of an autonomous run, so the agent knows what conditions to satisfy.
* **Merge Method Variations:** `--squash` was used, which is often fine. If preserving history is needed, the agent might use a regular merge or rebase merge. For now, squash merges are acceptable and even beneficial for experiment commits. We recommend sticking to squash merges to avoid multiple trivial commits cluttering history. The agent should also always use `--delete-branch` in this autonomous context to avoid orphan branches.
* **Post-merge Confirmation:** The agent performed an explicit post-merge sync in Experiment 0.9 (discussed next). This double-check is good. We recommend the agent continue to verify that the local main reflects the remote main after a merge, especially if any network or Git anomalies could occur. In most cases, `gh pr merge` already did that, but the verification adds confidence.

Overall, merging via CLI proved to be a strong capability of the agent, effectively closing the loop of the PR lifecycle. Future autonomous cycles can rely on this to integrate changes once they are approved (implicitly by the agent itself in this case).

## Post-Merge Sync Verification (Git Experiment 0.9)

**Analysis:** After merging, the agent ensured the local `main` branch was up-to-date by explicitly checking out `main` and pulling from origin. The output confirmed that the agent was already on `main` and that the branch was “Already up to date”. This was expected because `gh pr merge` had already fast-forwarded `main`. The agent’s reflection was that this step was redundant but served as a sanity check. No issues arose here – the commands were benign and the environment was clean.

**Recommendation:** While not strictly necessary, it’s a good practice for the agent to verify state after major operations like a merge. We recommend keeping a post-merge verification in the workflow, but it can be optimized:

* The agent could use `git status` or `gh pr view <PR>` after merge to confirm the PR’s state (merged/closed) and that the local repo has no diverging commits. This avoids even the minor overhead of a pull if not needed. In this experiment, the explicit `git pull` was harmless. In a scenario with many merges or if the repo is large, unnecessary pulls could be skipped.
* If the agent ever encountered a discrepancy (e.g., local not up to date due to a fast-forward issue or network lag), it would catch it here. None happened, but keeping the check means the agent can detect and correct any sync issues.

In summary, this step adds robustness. It’s low-cost and reassuring, so it should remain in the sequence as a safeguard when automating Git operations end-to-end.

## Cleanup of Temporary Files (Git Experiment 0.10)

**Analysis:** The agent cleaned up the temporary file used for the experiment (`temp_experiment_file.txt`) by invoking a file deletion tool (an internal agent capability). The tool reported success, and the agent considered the cleanup done. This removed the file from the working directory. However, note that since the file had been committed and merged into `main`, deleting it locally does not remove it from the repository’s history or remote – it just cleans the workspace. The experiment’s goal was to not leave clutter in the working copy, which was achieved.

**Recommendation:** For experimental runs, cleaning up artifacts in the working directory is useful to prepare for subsequent tests. The agent should continue to use its `delete_file` or similar tools to remove any files it created for test purposes once they are no longer needed. If the intention is to also remove such files from the repository (to not leave junk in the git history), the agent would have to create a new commit to delete the file from `main`. In this case, since the file was trivial, leaving it in history is not harmful. But as a recommendation for future cycles, the team might manually prune these experimental commits from `main` or the agent could be instructed to open a follow-up PR to remove experiment files if desired.

The key takeaway is that the agent can manage the filesystem as well as Git; it effectively ensures a clean state. This capability will be important when chaining multiple experiments – each run should ideally start with a clean repository state to avoid side-effects. So the agent (or the experiment runner) should always reset the environment or clean up like this, and the agent has shown it can contribute to that process.

---

## Recommendations for Next Experiments and Improvements

Based on the success and limitations observed in Experiments 0.1–0.10, we suggest the following adjustments and priorities for the upcoming experiments listed in `github_cli_plan.md`:

### 1. Robust CI Status Handling (High Priority)

Several planned experiments (Experiment Set 2: tests 4–7 in the plan) revolve around using `gh pr checks` in various scenarios (all success, some failing, streaming updates, pending checks). Given what we learned, **we should modify the approach in these experiments** to ensure the agent can actually retrieve the data:

* **Use JSON/API for Checks:** Instead of relying on the problematic `gh pr checks` output, configure the agent to use the GitHub API to get check runs. For instance, experiment 4 (“all successful checks”) can be done by calling `gh api` on the PR’s commit and verifying the agent correctly sees that all checks have conclusion `success`. This will test parsing in a reliable way. The agent can still attempt `gh pr checks` after setting `GH_PAGER=cat` as a secondary approach, to verify if the environment tweak works.
* **Simulate Failing Checks (Experiments 5 and 7):** Arrange a PR where one or more CI checks intentionally fail (e.g., introduce a code style violation or a failing test). The agent should fetch the check results and identify the failing check(s). We recommend focusing on the agent’s parsing logic here: can it list the failing checks by name and provide their URLs? The output from `gh pr checks --watch` (or API data) in this case will have specific lines or JSON fields for failed checks. The agent should be tested on extracting those. This is critical for autonomy because the agent needs to know *which* checks failed in order to possibly address them (or decide not to merge).
* **Streaming vs Polling (Experiment 6):** The plan suggests using `gh pr checks --watch` while new commits arrive. Given our experience, a fully autonomous agent might handle this by polling. We suggest modifying Experiment 6 to have the agent push an update to the PR (to retrigger CI) and then either use `--watch` or a polling loop to observe checks going from pending to done. The emphasis should be on whether the agent can track the change in status without human help. If streaming output is too hard to capture, this experiment can be accomplished by polling every few seconds with a regular `gh pr checks` call (with pagination off) or repeated API calls. The goal is to see if the agent can programmatically detect when previously failing checks turn successful (or vice versa) over time.
* **Pending Checks (Experiment 7):** This is essentially covered if we do the above. The agent should be exposed to the scenario of calling for status while checks are *in progress*. It should differentiate pending vs success vs failure states. We have partial evidence from Experiment 0.7 that the CLI indicated nothing useful when pending. If using the API, the agent can explicitly see `"status": "in_progress"` for those runs. So we advise using the API output to let the agent enumerate statuses and confirm it knows pending means “not ready yet.” This could be a quick sub-experiment where right after pushing a commit, the agent queries and finds checks with status pending and decides to wait.

By adjusting experiments 4–7 to use a combination of environment tweaks and API-based queries, we will directly address the major blocker identified (non-interactive CLI output). This will significantly increase the agent’s autonomy, as it will no longer need a human to tell it the CI results.

### 2. Handling Failing Checks and Re-Runs (High Priority)

In a realistic autonomous workflow, the agent must respond to failing CI checks, either by fixing code or by re-running flaky jobs. The plan’s Experiment Set 3 (tests 8 and 9) targets these scenarios:

* **Re-run Failed Checks (Experiment 8):** We recommend proceeding with this experiment soon after the agent can detect failing checks. In practice, the agent would use `gh run list` or `gh api` to find the workflow run ID(s) that failed. The plan suggests `gh run list --workflow=<name> --branch <branch> --status failure` to get the run ID. The agent should then call `gh run rerun <run-id>` to re-trigger those checks. An important aspect to observe is if the agent can correctly pick the relevant run – for example, a PR might have multiple workflows. The agent might need to identify which one failed (by name or just take all failed ones). We recommend designing the failing scenario with a known single failure to simplify this first test (e.g., introduce a lint error to fail a lint workflow only). The agent’s success criteria will be: it notices the failing check, finds the run ID, invokes the rerun, and then perhaps goes back to monitoring (as per Experiment 6) until the check passes.

  * *Fallback:* If `gh run rerun` is not feasible (maybe permissions or another quirk), the plan’s alternative of using a direct API call to the Actions endpoint can be tried. This will test the agent’s ability to use `gh api ... --method POST` for side-effect actions.
* **Merging with Failing Checks (Experiment 9):** This test is about the agent’s understanding of safeguards. If branch protection is configured to prevent merging with failing checks, `gh pr merge` will likely output an error or refuse. We should ensure branch protection is indeed on for this test (to simulate a real safeguard). The agent should attempt the merge, receive the error message, and interpret it correctly (i.e., realize the merge didn’t happen because checks failed). The expected CLI output might be something like “Pull request has failing checks and cannot be merged” or the merge command might exit with an error code. The agent should capture that and respond by not considering the PR closed.

  * If the repository doesn’t have protections, merging might succeed even with failures (which would be undesirable). In that case, the agent would inadvertently merge a broken commit. To avoid this, we strongly suggest enabling required status checks on the test branch for this experiment. That way, we can test the agent’s reaction to the merge-blocking mechanism. The agent’s recommendation in such a scenario might be to attempt a re-run (as above) or decide to leave the PR open for human intervention. Testing this will clarify if the agent can gracefully handle “stop, you can’t merge” messages.

Both of these experiments (8 and 9) are critical for autonomous operation because they teach the agent how to maintain code quality and respect repository rules. They should be prioritized after fixing the basic check visibility (from point 1). By the end of these, the agent would not only create and merge PRs, but also deal with the situation when things aren’t green.

### 3. PR Metadata Management (Medium Priority)

Less critical for full autonomy, but still useful for completeness, are experiments around PR metadata (Experiment Set 1: tests 1–3):

* **Reviewers and Labels (Exp 1):** The agent will create a PR with reviewers and labels. We anticipate the CLI will succeed in assigning them if the names/labels exist. The key question is whether the agent can “use” that information. For example, after creation, the agent might call `gh pr view --json labels,reviewRequests` to see who was requested and if it affects its decision-making. In an autonomous scenario, adding a reviewer might not make sense (since the agent is trying to operate without humans), but the experiment is still valuable to ensure the agent can handle additional options. We recommend performing this test to verify no regressions in PR creation with extra flags, and to see if the agent can parse the confirmation output (which likely lists the reviewers/labels).

  * After this, if the agent is meant to wait for a human reviewer’s approval, that enters a semi-autonomous mode. That might be outside the immediate scope of full autonomy, but it’s good to document how the agent recognizes an approved review if we ever integrate that (perhaps via `gh pr checks` which includes a “Reviewer approved” check or via `gh pr view --json reviewDecision`).
* **Draft PR (Exp 2):** This experiment will have the agent create a PR as a draft. The main thing to verify is that the agent knows a draft PR should not be merged until it’s marked ready. The agent can detect a PR’s draft status via the `--json` output of `gh pr view` (the field `isDraft` or similar). We recommend adding a step where after creating a draft PR, the agent checks its status. Ideally, the agent should then not proceed to merge even if CI is passing. In an autonomous workflow, the agent itself could convert the PR to ready state using `gh pr ready <PR>` when it decides to merge. Testing that command could be a nice extension of this experiment. This ensures the agent can handle the full lifecycle of a draft PR (create as draft, later mark ready, then merge).
* **Listing and Filtering PRs (Exp 3):** The agent listing PRs is a utility function – for example, finding if there are existing open PRs it should pay attention to, or searching for its own PRs. We saw the push output gave a URL for creating a new PR, but the agent chose `gh pr create` directly. In cases where the agent might run in an environment with multiple PRs, using `gh pr list` with filters could help it identify relevant PRs by author or label. We suggest still performing this experiment to ensure the agent can parse list outputs. The CLI returns a table of PRs for `gh pr list`. To make parsing easier, the agent can use `gh pr list --json number,title,headRefName,labels` etc., which would give structured data. A learning from earlier steps is to prefer `--json` where possible. So modify the experiment to use JSON output for listing PRs. The agent should demonstrate it can filter by state or label (e.g., list only open PRs with a certain label). This is moderately important for housekeeping – e.g., the agent could close stale PRs or avoid duplicating work if it finds one already open for a given issue.

These metadata-focused experiments are not blockers for autonomy, but they round out the agent’s capabilities and might be prerequisites for more advanced behavior (like coordinating with humans or managing multiple concurrent PRs). They can be tackled after the higher priority CI-focused tests, or in parallel if resources allow.

### 4. Extracting and Using CI Log Data (Lower Priority / Future Exploration)

Experiment Set 4 (test 10) in the plan goes into extracting log URLs from failed checks and possibly reading their contents. This is an ambitious step toward the agent diagnosing failures:

* **Log URL Extraction:** In a failing checks scenario, each failing check usually has a URL (often an Actions run URL or a link to a log page). The `gh pr checks --watch` output from Experiment 0.7b showed URLs for each check run. The agent could parse those URLs for failed checks. We recommend implementing this extraction once the agent reliably gets the raw output or JSON of check runs. If using the API (`check-runs` endpoint), the JSON includes a `details_url` for each run, which can be captured for the failing ones.
* **Interpreting Log Content:** The plan notes this as an expected limitation. Indeed, even if the agent obtains a URL to a failing log, accessing it would require either an API call to download logs or some HTML scraping if it’s a web page. This might be beyond the current capabilities (and possibly out of scope, since it edges into reading unstructured build logs which is a hard NLP problem on its own). We agree with the plan’s implication that fully understanding the log content is likely too much for now. A more achievable intermediate goal is for the agent to at least report the URL or maybe fetch the raw text of the log and look for obvious keywords (like an error message or stack trace).

  * GitHub Actions logs can be retrieved via the API (`gh run view <id> --log` might print the log to console, or `gh run download` to get artifacts). The agent could attempt `gh run view <run-id> --log` for a failed run and capture some lines. This is a potential experiment: see if the agent can pick out a error line or test failure line from a log. We label this lower priority because it’s not strictly needed for merging or not merging; it’s more about guiding a fix.

For now, the main recommendation is to design Experiment 10 such that the agent focuses on extracting the links for failed checks and perhaps just acknowledges that deeper analysis would require advanced parsing. We can defer heavy log analysis until the agent has more fundamental capabilities solidified.

### 5. Enhancing Non-Interactive Robustness (Continuous Consideration)

Across all future experiments, we should keep the agent’s execution environment and the non-interactivity in mind:

* Make sure every `gh` command used has flags for non-interactive use (no editors popping up, no confirmations needed). We saw success with `gh pr create` by providing title/body, and with `gh pr merge` by providing flags. Continue this practice (for example, if deleting a branch or other commands, use `--yes` or equivalent flags if they exist).
* Use `--json` outputs whenever parsing is needed. Many `gh` subcommands support `--json` to return structured data. This will save the agent from brittle text parsing and avoid pager issues. For instance, `gh pr view --json ...`, `gh pr list --json ...`, `gh issue list --json ...` etc., can be leveraged.
* Implement a global environment tweak for the agent sessions to avoid paging (as discussed, `GH_PAGER`). This single configuration might resolve a host of issues (the initial branch protection query in Attempt 1 also fell victim to a pager). We should repeat the branch protection query after disabling pager to confirm the agent can get that information. If it can, the agent will know up front if merges will be blocked by unmet conditions and can plan accordingly (e.g., if it found that at least 1 review is required, it could auto-assign itself or a bot user as a reviewer or decide to use admin privileges).

By applying these considerations, we ensure that as the agent attempts more complex tasks, it doesn’t stumble on CLI usability issues that are unrelated to its reasoning. This will let us truly test the agent’s decision-making and capabilities.

## Conclusion

The first 10 experiments validated that a frontier-level reasoning LLM can autonomously manage a Git workflow from creating a branch through merging a PR, given proper tooling and environment. Key capabilities like branch creation, committing, pushing, and PR creation worked seamlessly and open the door to fully automated code changes. The main limitations observed were around retrieving information (CI status) in a non-interactive setting, which we plan to solve by tweaking the CLI usage or using direct API calls. Going forward, the focus shifts to making the agent not just go through the motions of a happy-path PR, but also handle the less happy paths – failed checks, required reviews, draft statuses, etc. Each recommendation above is aimed at **accelerating the agent’s autonomy** in dealing with these scenarios and **ensuring robustness** even when the environment or outputs are not ideal. By prioritizing CI checks handling and failure recovery in the next wave of experiments, we can significantly enhance the agent’s ability to manage the full PR lifecycle with minimal to no human intervention, bringing us closer to a truly self-sufficient dev agent.

## Appendix B · Two New Experiment Tracks

### Track 1 “Diff-First” Workflow (No shell required)

1. **Goal:** Prove the Agent can raise a PR, validate CI, and merge *without ever parsing CLI stdout*—relying on Cursor’s diff/context injection and MCP API calls instead.
2. **Steps:**

   * Use `@Branch` to generate summary and PR body.
   * Use MCP to open the PR and poll check-runs JSON.
   * Merge via MCP (or fall back to `gh pr merge`) once all checks are successful.
3. **Success metric:** zero pager errors; 100 % JSON-based decisions.

### Track 2 Model-Swap Efficiency Study

1. **Goal:** Quantify benefits of multi-model hand-offs on long-running watch/poll loops.
2. **Design:**

   * **Phase A:** Single-model (GPT-4 / o3) end-to-end run.
   * **Phase B:** Planner = Gemini 2.5; Executor = GPT-4.
3. **Metrics:** wall-clock time, token usage, number of human interventions, success rate.

### Where to slot these Two New Experiment Tracks

* **Add Appendix A** straight after the recommendations section of the main report.
* **In `github_cli_plan.md`** create two new top-level experiment sets—“Diff-First Workflow” and “Model-Swap Efficiency Study”—and list the concrete steps above.
* Mark them **Priority = Medium** (after we resolve non-interactive CI polling), because they become far more valuable once the baseline `gh` workflow is solid.

These additions keep our GitHub-CLI focus but fold in Cursor-native strengths, giving the Agent alternate pathways when CLI quirks bite and letting us measure real productivity gains from Cursor’s larger model toolbox.
