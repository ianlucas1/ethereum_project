# Welcome to the Ethereum Econometric Valuation Analysis Documentation

This site provides comprehensive technical documentation for the **Ethereum Econometric Valuation Analysis** project (`ianlucas1/ethereum_project`).

## Project Overview

This project conducts an econometric analysis of Ethereum (ETH) valuation, primarily exploring its relationship with network activity metrics, drawing inspiration from Metcalfe's Law. It aims to identify key drivers of ETH's value using various statistical models. The project fetches, processes, and analyzes on-chain and market data for Ethereum and benchmark assets like the NASDAQ index.

The primary execution script is `src/main.py`, which runs the complete end-to-end analysis pipeline. For interactive data exploration, model development, and visualization, `research.py` provides a suitable environment.

## Navigating the Documentation

This documentation is organized into several key sections to help you understand, use, and contribute to the project:
