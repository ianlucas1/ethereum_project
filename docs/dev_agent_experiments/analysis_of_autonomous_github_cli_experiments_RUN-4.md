Executive Summary (198 words)

Run 4 delivered three concrete improvements to the autonomous GitHub-CLI workflow and exposed a fragile point in the logging process.
	1	Security gate restored: removing the stray -r . flag from the Bandit pre-commit hook let the security scanner run cleanly again, surfacing real Low-severity issues instead of crashing 【repo://.pre-commit-config.yaml】.
	2	CI ⇄ local lint alignment: a new lint.yml workflow now runs Flake8 with the same 88-char line-length and ignore list used locally, and the static-security workflow now calls bandit -r . -s B101 -ll, matching pre-commit and the main CI job 【repo://.github/workflows/lint.yml】【repo://.github/workflows/static-security.yml】.
	3	Rerun capability proven: the agent re-triggered the failing run-id 14957856078 on PR #120 via gh run rerun, confirming it can programmatically restart workflows that block merges 【repo://docs/dev_agent_experiments/github_cli_execution_log.md】.
	4	Log-file integrity risk: an edit_file append mis-fired on the 800-line execution log, forcing a manual patch and proving the current diff-based update method is brittle 【repo://local/Run 4 CoT】.
These results re-order near-term priorities: tackle merge-block behaviour (3-9), implement CI log-scraping (4-11), and add context-window self-trimming (9-1) before attempting merge-queue auto-rebasing (5-1/5-2) or auto-remediation (Set 6). Improving log-update safety and keeping lint/security settings in sync are the key optimisation themes for the next cycle.

Key Run 4 Outcomes
#
Outcome
Evidence
3-11
Bandit pre-commit hook fixed — Bandit now runs and reports 6 Low findings; no argument-parsing crash.
repo://.pre-commit-config.yaml (diff)
3-10
Flake8 added to CI and Bandit severity/skip flags unified across all workflows.
repo://.github/workflows/lint.yml, repo://.github/workflows/static-security.yml
3-8
CI rerun works — gh run rerun 14957856078 restarted the same run-id on PR #120.
repo://docs/dev_agent_experiments/github_cli_execution_log.md (§Exp 3-8)
Log incident
edit_file failed on the large log; agent emitted manual-patch instructions.
repo://local/Run 4 CoT

New Risks / Limitations
	1	Log-file corruption risk — diff-based edits on a large markdown file can truncate or overwrite content 【repo://local/Run 4 CoT】.
	2	Lint/security config drift — Flake8 had been entirely absent from CI, and Bandit severity rules differed until Run 4’s fix 【repo://docs/dev_agent_experiments/github_cli_plan.md】.
	3	Silent tool failure — the former Bandit hook bug shows that a disabled safeguard can hide for many runs without explicit detection 【repo://.pre-commit-config.yaml】.

Optimisation Suggestions
Area
Recommendation
Logging
Split execution logs per run or append via a simple echo >> style helper that never rewrites prior lines; verify file size after write.
CI ↔ pre-commit parity
Add a nightly “lint-config-diff” workflow that compares .pre-commit-config.yaml against workflows and fails if they diverge.
CI rerun semantics
Teach agent that gh run rerun reuses the same run-id; use gh run watch 14957856078 (or API) to follow progress precisely.
