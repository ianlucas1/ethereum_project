# Ethereum Econometric Valuation Analysis

## 🤖 AI Agent Development Workflow

This project utilizes an experimental, autonomous AI agent-driven workflow to assist with ongoing development, task management, and quality assurance. This system is orchestrated by a series of scripts (in `scripts/`) and guided by detailed instructional prompts (in `prompts/`).

Key aspects of this workflow include:
*   Automated task progression based on a structured roadmap (`prompts/roadmap.jsonl`).
*   Dynamic updates to a central agent control prompt (`prompts/starter_prompt.txt`).
*   Regular automated code quality audits (`scripts/qa_audit.py`) with results tracked in `prompts/quality_scoreboard.md`.
*   Automated code implementation, testing, PR creation, and logging for defined roadmap tasks.

While this system aims for a high degree of autonomy, human oversight is maintained, particularly for PR reviews and strategic roadmap planning. This workflow is an active component of how the `ethereum_project` evolves.

**For a detailed explanation of this AI agent workflow, its components, and operational phases, please see [`docs/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md).**

Contributors working on the core econometric analysis can generally ignore the specifics of this agent system. However, those interested in the meta-development process or looking to modify the agent's behavior should consult the detailed documentation.

## Overview

This project conducts an econometric analysis of Ethereum (ETH) valuation, primarily exploring its relationship with network activity metrics, drawing inspiration from Metcalfe's Law. It aims to identify key drivers of ETH's value using various statistical models. The project fetches, processes, and analyzes on-chain and market data for Ethereum and benchmark assets like the NASDAQ index.

The primary execution script is `main.py`, which runs the complete end-to-end analysis pipeline. For interactive data exploration, model development, and visualization, `research.py` provides a suitable environment.

## Key Features

*   **Data Fetching**: Retrieves on-chain data (e.g., active addresses, transaction counts) and market data (prices, volumes) from various APIs.
*   **Data Processing**: Cleans, transforms, merges, and resamples raw data into daily and monthly frequencies suitable for analysis.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes outlier treatment (e.g., winsorization) and stationarity testing (e.g., ADF tests) on time series data.
*   **Econometric Modeling**: Implements and evaluates several models:
    *   Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) benchmarks.
    *   Vector Error Correction Models (VECM).
    *   Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) models.
*   **Model Diagnostics**: Performs residual analysis and structural break tests.
*   **Out-of-Sample Validation**: Conducts rolling window validation to assess model robustness.
*   **Reporting**: Generates a structured JSON file (`final_results.json`) with all analysis results and prints a summary interpretation.

## Technology Stack

*   **Language**: Python
*   **Core Libraries**:
    *   `pandas` (for data manipulation)# Ethereum Econometric Valuation Analysis

*Note on `prompts/` and `scripts/` directories: These may contain auxiliary files used during development (e.g., LLM prompts, custom QA scripts). They are not required for running the core analysis pipeline and can generally be ignored by new contributors focused on the main application logic.*

## Modules (`src/` directory)

*   `config.py`: Manages project settings and API keys, primarily by loading them from an `.env` file.
*   `data_fetching.py`: Handles fetching raw data from external APIs (e.g., CoinMetrics, Yahoo Finance), including caching mechanisms.
*   `data_processing.py`: Cleans, transforms, merges, and resamples raw data into analysis-ready `daily_clean.parquet` and `monthly_clean.parquet` datasets.
*   `diagnostics.py`: Implements model diagnostic tests, such as residual analysis and structural break tests.
*   `eda.py`: Provides functions for exploratory data analysis, including data winsorization and stationarity tests (e.g., ADF).
*   `ols_models.py`: Implements Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) benchmark models.
*   `reporting.py`: Generates summaries of analysis results, formats them into a structured dictionary, and handles JSON serialization.
*   `ts_models.py`: Implements time series models like Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) and Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) models.
*   `validation.py`: Handles out-of-sample model validation, particularly rolling window validation, ensuring preprocessing steps are applied correctly within each window to prevent data leakage.
*   `utils/`: A sub-package containing various utility modules:
    *   `cache.py`: Caching utilities.
    *   `api_helpers.py`: Helper functions for interacting with external APIs.
    *   `file_io.py`: Utilities for file input/output.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ethereum_project
    ```

2.  **Ensure Correct Python Version:**
    *   The project is configured to use **Python 3.11** for local development, as specified in the `.python-version` file (used by tools like `pyenv`).
    *   The `Dockerfile` uses **Python 3.12-slim** for containerized execution.
    *   Ensure you have Python 3.11 accessible for local work. Check with `python --version` (if `pyenv` is active) or `python3.11 --version`.

3.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment (using Python 3.11):**
    ```bash
    # Using Python 3.11
    python3.11 -m venv .venv

    # Activate on macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # Activate on Windows (Git Bash):
    # source .venv/Scripts/activate
    ```
    Ensure `.venv/` is in your `.gitignore`.

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the exact dependencies from the lock file for a reproducible environment:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
    ```

5.  **Developer Dependencies (Optional):**
    For development (running linters, type checkers, tests locally):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```
    It's recommended to set up `pre-commit` hooks:
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

6.  **Environment Variables (`.env` file):**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root for API keys and other configurations. `src/config.py` loads these variables.
    Example `.env` content:
    ```dotenv
    RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
    CM_API_KEY=your_coinmetrics_key_here # Optional
    ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key_here # Optional (currently not used by the core pipeline but reserved for potential future features)
    ```
    Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

### Full Pipeline Execution

1.  Activate your virtual environment (e.g., `source .venv/bin/activate`).
2.  Ensure required environment variables (at least `RAPIDAPI_KEY`) are set in your `.env` file or system environment.
3.  Run `main.py` from the project root:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This executes the entire pipeline: data fetching/checking, processing, EDA, modeling, and report generation (output to `final_results.json` and console summary).

### Interactive Research

1.  Open the `ethereum_project` folder in an IDE supporting interactive Python (VS Code, Cursor, PyCharm, Jupyter).
2.  Ensure the IDE's Python interpreter is set to the project's virtual environment (`.venv/bin/python`).
3.  Open `research.py`. This file uses `#%%` cell markers for interactive execution.
    *   The first cell loads data (run `main.py` once first to generate `daily_clean.parquet` and `monthly_clean.parquet`).
    *   Subsequent cells provide examples for plotting and analysis.

## Testing

Tests are run using `pytest`. Ensure development dependencies are installed.
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report (as in CI)
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml
# HTML report will be in htmlcov/
```

## Running with Docker

The project includes a `Dockerfile` for building and running in an isolated container environment.

1.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t ethereum_project .
    ```

2.  **Run Tests in the Container:**
    ```bash
    docker run --rm ethereum_project pytest -q
    ```

3.  **Run the Main Application in the Container:**
    ```bash
    # Using the dummy RAPIDAPI_KEY set in the Dockerfile (may not fetch live data)
    docker run --rm ethereum_project

    # To use a real API key for live data fetching:
    docker run --rm -e RAPIDAPI_KEY="your_actual_rapidapi_key" ethereum_project
    ```
    The Docker image is based on `python:3.12-slim`.
