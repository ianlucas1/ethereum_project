Okay, I will begin by inspecting the CI and linting configurations as requested.
First, I'll list the files in the .github/workflows/ directory to understand which CI workflows are present.
Now that I have the list of workflow files, I will read the content of .github/workflows/ci.yml and .github/workflows/static-security.yml as they seem most relevant to linting and testing. I already have the content of .pre-commit-config.yaml from the initial context.
I'll examine these files to check for:
flake8 E501 ignore setting.
Bandit's --severity-level medium setting.
The local Bandit pre-commit hook configuration (which I'll cross-reference with .pre-commit-config.yaml).
Okay, I've reviewed the files. Here's what I found regarding the CI-lint behavior:
Flake8 E501 is ignored (--ignore=E501):
The .pre-commit-config.yaml file shows Flake8 is configured with args: [--max-line-length=88, --ignore=E203,W503]. This does not explicitly ignore E501 (line too long).
The ci.yml workflow runs pytest -q but doesn't seem to run flake8 directly as a separate step. It's possible flake8 is run as part of another script or pytest plugin, but it's not evident in this CI file. The .github/workflows/python-ci.yml might be relevant here, as it's more comprehensive.
Bandit runs with --severity-level medium (thus skipping low-severity B101):
The .github/workflows/static-security.yml file has a step: Bandit — fail on ≥ MEDIUM which runs bandit -r . --severity-level medium. This configuration means it will report issues of medium severity or higher, effectively skipping low-severity ones like B101 (assert_used).
However, the ci.yml workflow, in its bandit_safety job, runs bandit -r . -s B101 -ll. This command specifically targets B101 (-s B101) and uses -ll to report medium and high severity issues. This is a bit contradictory to the static-security.yml setup. The -s B101 will only show B101 if it's medium or high, but B101 is typically low. This setup might not be behaving as expected.
The local Bandit pre-commit hook fails because it mixes -r . with filenames:
The .pre-commit-config.yaml shows the Bandit hook as:
Apply
]
The args: ["-r", ".", "-s", "B101"] indeed uses -r . which tells Bandit to scan the current directory recursively. Pre-commit hooks typically pass a list of changed filenames to the tool. If Bandit receives filenames and -r ., it can lead to issues or scan more than intended/ignore the specific files. The problem statement says it "fails"; this configuration is likely the cause if Bandit doesn't correctly handle both recursive mode and explicit filenames.
To get a clearer picture of the Flake8 situation in CI, I'll quickly check the python-ci.yml workflow file.
After reviewing python-ci.yml, it also does not explicitly run flake8. It primarily focuses on setting up Python, caching dependencies, and running pytest -q -n auto.
So, for Flake8 E501:
The .pre-commit-config.yaml for local checks does not ignore E501. It has --max-line-length=88.
None of the inspected CI workflow files (ci.yml, static-security.yml, python-ci.yml) explicitly run flake8 as a standalone linting step. It's possible it's integrated into pytest or another tool, or perhaps linting with flake8 isn't a dedicated step in these particular CI workflows, relying more on the pre-commit hooks.
Correction: I need to look closer at the pre-commit config. It does have flake8.
Apply
W503
This configuration does not include E501 in its ignore list. So, the statement "flake8 E501 is ignored (--ignore=E501)" in the user prompt is currently false based on .pre-commit-config.yaml. If there is a CI step for flake8, it's not in the files I've checked so far. The user asked me to confirm these things, so I should report the discrepancies.
Let's summarize the findings for step 1 and prepare to write them to github_cli_execution_log.md.
Summary of CI-lint behaviour diagnosis:
Flake8 E501 ignore status:
The .pre-commit-config.yaml specifies flake8 with args: [--max-line-length=88, --ignore=E203,W503].
E501 (line too long) is not in this ignore list. Therefore, lines longer than 88 characters should be flagged by the local pre-commit hook.
No explicit flake8 execution (and thus no E501 ignore rule) was found in the CI workflow files: ci.yml, static-security.yml, or python-ci.yml. Linting in CI might be handled differently or not at all by a direct flake8 call.
Bandit severity level in CI:
.github/workflows/static-security.yml runs Bandit with bandit -r . --severity-level medium. This correctly skips low-severity issues like B101 (assert_used) by only failing on medium or higher.
.github/workflows/ci.yml (in the bandit_safety job) runs Bandit with bandit -r . -s B101 -ll. This command seems misconfigured: -s B101 tells Bandit to only report B101, while -ll reports medium and high severity. Since B101 is typically a low-severity issue, this command in ci.yml would likely report nothing for B101 unless its severity has been changed in Bandit's config (not shown). This contradicts the behavior in static-security.yml.
Local Bandit pre-commit hook:
The .pre-commit-config.yaml configures the Bandit hook with args: ["-r", ".", "-s", "B101"].
The argument -r . tells Bandit to scan the current directory recursively. Pre-commit hooks pass specific filenames to tools. Using -r . alongside specific filenames can cause Bandit to either ignore the filenames and scan everything, or behave unexpectedly. This mixing is a likely cause for the hook "failing" or not working as intended when processing individual files.
I will now update github_cli_execution_log.md with these findings.
I'll first read the existing content to append correctly.
The log file docs/dev_agent_experiments/github_cli_execution_log.md has been updated with the diagnosis of CI-lint behaviour.
Now, I will proceed to Task 2: Experiment 2-5b — Guaranteed failing CI check.
First, I will create the failing test file tests/test_fail.py.
The failing test file tests/test_fail.py has been created.
Next, I need to ensure the test workflow runs PyTest on pull_request events. I'll inspect .github/workflows/ci.yml again (which I have in memory) and also .github/workflows/python-ci.yml more closely for its triggers and PyTest execution.
From my earlier check of ci.yml:
Apply
.
This ci.yml workflow does run on pull_request and executes pytest -q.
Now, let's re-check python-ci.yml:
Apply
auto
The python-ci.yml workflow also runs on pull_request but only against the main branch. This means if I open a PR from experiment/2-5b-failing-test to main, this workflow should trigger and run pytest -q -n auto.
It seems the existing workflows should cover running PyTest. I don't think a separate tests-ci.yml is needed.
Now, I will proceed to commit and push the new test file on a new branch experiment/2-5b-failing-test. I'll use GH_PAGER=cat for all gh commands as per the instructions.
The commit failed due to pre-commit hooks:
black reformatted the file.
flake8 reported B011 Do not call assert False... (This is likely flake8-bugbear's B011, not Bandit's B101).
bandit failed with error: unrecognized arguments: tests/test_fail.py. This confirms the issue with the local Bandit pre-commit hook identified in Task 1: it's not handling filenames correctly when -r . is also in its args.
The instructions state: "(Use --no-verify only if local hooks block the commit.)". Since the hooks blocked the commit, I will now attempt the commit and push again using --no-verify.
The commit and push were successful using --no-verify. The branch experiment/2-5b-failing-test is now on the remote.
Next, I will open a Pull Request to main.
Pull Request #120 has been created: https://github.com/ianlucas1/ethereum_project/pull/120
Now, I will poll the CI status for PR #120 until completion, looking for a failure. I'll use both gh pr checks <PR#> and the API call. I'll start by checking the status once.
For the API call, I need the owner and repo. From previous logs, it's ianlucas1/ethereum_project.
The gh pr checks 120 command shows that checks are still pending (exit code 8). This is expected. I will now use the API call to get a snapshot.
The API call also confirms that most checks are in_progress with conclusion: null. One lockfile-consistency check has status: "completed", conclusion: "success".
I need to wait and poll again. I will use gh pr checks 120 --watch to wait for completion, as this command exits when checks are done. This might take a few minutes.
Excellent! The gh pr checks 120 --watch command completed and reported:
Some checks were not successful
0 cancelled, 3 failing, 9 successful, 1 skipped, and 0 pending checks
The failing checks are:
CI/build (push) - URL: https://github.com/ianlucas1/ethereum_project/actions/runs/14957855159/job/42015948378
CI/build (pull_request) - URL: https://github.com/ianlucas1/ethereum_project/actions/runs/14957856075/job/42015951692
Python CI/test (ubuntu-latest, 3.12) (pull_request) - URL: https://github.com/ianlucas1/ethereum_project/actions/runs/14957856078/job/42015951707
These are the PyTest execution steps, as expected. The assert False in tests/test_fail.py correctly caused the test runs to fail.
I will now confirm with the API call to get the conclusion=="failure" run. I will select the first one reported that matches the head branch and has a failure conclusion.
The API call confirms a failing check:
Name: Python CI
Conclusion: failure
URL: https://github.com/ianlucas1/ethereum_project/actions/runs/14957856078
This matches one of the failing checks identified by gh pr checks --watch.
Task 2 is now complete. I will record this in github_cli_execution_log.md.
I'll read the log file first to append correctly.
The execution log docs/dev_agent_experiments/github_cli_execution_log.md has been updated with the details of Experiment 2-5b.
Now for Task 3: Update the plan.
I need to append the specified new experiment entries to docs/dev_agent_experiments/github_cli_plan.md.
I'll read the file first.
The github_cli_plan.md file has been updated with the new experiment entries.
Task 4 is the stop condition:
PR with failing test exists and CI reports at least one failed check: Done (PR #120, Python CI failed).
Name + URL of the failing check are logged: Done (In github_cli_execution_log.md).
github_cli_execution_log.md is fully updated: Done.
github_cli_plan.md contains the new experiment entries: Done.
All conditions for stopping this run have been met.
I will not attempt to fix or merge the failing PR #120.
This concludes Run 3 of the GitHub CLI experiments.
