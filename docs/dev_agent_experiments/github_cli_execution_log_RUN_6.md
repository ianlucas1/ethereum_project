### Run 6 Kickoff & Initial Plan

**Agent's Pre-Action Reasoning (Chain of Thought - CoT):**
Initiating Run 6 as per the kickoff prompt. Will follow the prescribed Phase A (Maintenance) steps, starting with archiving legacy analysis reports and persisting the kickoff prompt. All actions will be logged here before any code or documentation changes, per hygiene rules.

**Kickoff Instructions:**
(See `docs/dev_agent_experiments/prompts/RUN_6_kickoff.md` for the full kickoff prompt.)

**Planned Next Steps:**
1. Archive legacy run-analysis reports and CoT message history files.
2. Persist the kickoff prompt to the prompts directory and update the README.
3. Bootstrap the agent environment script.
4. Prepare the environment and verify pager variables.
5. Repair and self-test the hook-guard workflow.
6. Switch to per-run logging and update references.
7. Run pre-commit parity check and sync the plan/dashboard.
8. Clean up stale PRs and branches.

All actions will be logged here with mini-summaries after each experiment or maintenance step.
