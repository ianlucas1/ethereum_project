# Roadmap Status Evaluation Prompt — **ethereum_project**
########################################################################################

## Objective
Determine **precisely which roadmap step is *currently active*** in the `prompts/roadmap.md` document by analysing the live code-base, its tests, configuration files and any status markers (e.g. ✅, 🟡, ☐, DONE, IN PROGRESS).

> This prompt is meant for the *coding-agent* running inside Cursor IDE.  It assumes the agent has read-only access to the repository and can perform semantic searches (`codebase_search`), regex searches (`grep_search`), and file reads (`read_file`).  The human will run any terminal commands you propose.

## Inputs you can rely on
1. The full repository (latest commit on the current branch).
2. `prompts/roadmap.md` — authoritative source of roadmap steps & statuses.
3. Configuration files (`README.md`, `PROJECT_CONFIG_DETAILS.md`, CI workflows) for additional clues.

## Tasks
1. Parse `prompts/roadmap.md` to extract every step with its **code** (e.g., *6.1*), **title**, and **status icon/word**.
2. Identify the *single* step whose status is *most consistent* with the current code-base state.  Use evidence such as:
   • Presence/absence of implemented functions, tests, or files mentioned in a roadmap step.
   • CI or coverage badges / reports committed to the repo.
   • Commit messages or tags that match roadmap milestones.
   • Status flags inside the roadmap itself (e.g., "🟡 IN PROGRESS").
3. Produce a short **justification** citing concrete evidence lines using Cursor's code-citation format `startLine:endLine:filepath` (max 3 citations).
4. Output the **determined roadmap step code** (e.g., `6.1`) and its human-readable title.
5. If the roadmap appears *out of sync* with reality (e.g., tasks completed in code but still marked open), highlight the discrepancy and suggest an update.

## Output format
```
Current roadmap step: <CODE> — "<TITLE>"

Justification:
1. <citation> – <why it matters>
2. <citation> – <why it matters>
3. <citation> – <why it matters>

Sync status: <OK | OUT-OF-SYNC>

If OUT-OF-SYNC:
    Suggested change: "…"  (≤ 120 chars)
```

## Guard-rails & best practices
• **Ask follow-up questions** if anything is ambiguous or additional context is needed.
• Use **Cursor code citations** so the human can jump straight to evidence.
• Keep the entire answer ≤ 200 words (excluding citations).
• Do *not* modify any files yourself; only analyse and report.
• If you encounter conflicting evidence, explain briefly and pick the *most defensible* conclusion.

When you are ready, begin by parsing `prompts/roadmap.md` and continue with the tasks above.
