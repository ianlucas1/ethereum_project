# Analysis of Autonomous GitHub CLI Experiments – Run 2 Updates

## Executive Summary (Run 2 Findings)

In this second run of autonomous GitHub CLI experiments, the agent focused on improving CI status retrieval and testing failure handling. **First, a configuration tweak (setting `GH_PAGER=cat`) successfully eliminated prior CLI pager issues**, allowing the agent to reliably poll PR check results without human help. Second, the agent **attempted to induce a CI failure via code lint violations (flake8 E501 line-length and Bandit B101 assert usage)**. Unexpectedly, none of these attempts triggered a failing check in CI. The investigation revealed **configuration mismatches**: flake8’s line-length rule E501 was explicitly ignored in the repo’s config, and Bandit’s “assert used” rule B101 is categorized as low severity, which the CI’s static analysis job does not flag as failure. The agent’s local pre-commit hook for Bandit also failed due to an argument conflict, requiring hook bypass. As a result, the agent still has not observed a CI failure case, highlighting a **gap in its ability to learn failure-response behaviors**. We recommend a new experiment to produce a guaranteed CI failure (introducing a failing unit test) so the agent can practice detecting and logging failing checks. We also suggest investigating and aligning CI vs local lint configurations to avoid confusion.

## Experiment 2-4′: Confirming PR Check Polling with Pager Disabled

**Objective:** Verify that disabling the GitHub CLI’s pager (`GH_PAGER=cat`) resolves previous output capture issues, and confirm the agent can autonomously monitor an all-success CI run.

**Action:** The agent created a trivial change (adding `pager_test_pass.txt`) and opened PR #113. It then set environment variable `GH_PAGER=cat` and used `gh pr checks <PR#> --watch` to poll for CI results.

**Outcome:** The agent successfully retrieved the real-time status of checks without encountering the `head: |: No such file or directory` pager error. Once CI completed, `gh pr checks --watch` output confirmed **all checks passed** (11 successful, 1 skipped). The skipped check was a known CodeQL meta-check. The agent also cross-validated using a GitHub API call for check runs, seeing all conclusions as “success” (with one “neutral” for the skipped check). These results prove that **`GH_PAGER=cat` effectively forces non-interactive output** and enables the agent to autonomously detect when all CI checks are green. The agent noted this fix as a key enabler for headless CI monitoring.

## Experiment 2-5′: Attempts to Induce a Failing CI Check

**Objective:** Simulate a CI **failure** scenario and observe how the agent detects and logs the failing check. The agent attempted multiple strategies to introduce a known failing condition in a PR, focusing on **flake8’s E501 (line too long)** and **Bandit’s B101 (assert statement)** rules.

**Attempts and Observations:** Initially, the agent added a new Python file with an overly long line to trigger flake8 E501. However, the local pre-commit hooks auto-formatted the file (Black) and prevented any E501 issue from reaching CI. Next, the agent tried using a long **comment** line (not fixed by Black) to force an E501. This did yield a local flake8 error, but the **commit was blocked by the pre-commit hook for Bandit** encountering an error (`unrecognized arguments`) when processing the staged file. The agent discovered that the Bandit hook was configured to run `bandit -r . -s B101` (skip rule B101) and was choking when pre-commit passed specific filenames. To proceed, the agent bypassed hooks (`git commit --no-verify`) to push the change and open PR #115.

Despite containing an intentional E501 violation, **CI still reported all checks passing on PR #115**. The agent then examined the repo configuration and found that in **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, flake8 is configured with `--ignore=E203,E501,W503`**. In other words, the CI (which relies on pre-commit hooks or consistent configs) was explicitly **ignoring E501**, so a long-line error would never fail the lint check. Armed with this insight, the agent pivoted strategy.

Next, the agent attempted to trigger **Bandit rule B101** (assert use) directly. It created a new file `fail_bandit_b101.py` with an `assert True` and opened PR #117. Locally, this again tripped the Bandit hook argument error (skipping B101 while receiving a filename), so the agent committed with hooks disabled. The expectation was that the CI’s “Bandit & Safety” check would flag the assert. **Yet PR #117 also saw all checks pass**. The agent discovered why: the GitHub Actions workflow (`static-security.yml`) runs Bandit with a **severity level filter of “medium”** (`--severity-level medium`). Bandit categorizes B101 (use of assert) as **Low severity**, so the CI effectively **does not treat B101 as a failure condition**. In summary, the CI pipeline was configured such that **neither the flake8 E501 nor Bandit B101 would ever cause a failing status**, explaining the agent’s inability to induce a failure in those attempts.

**Result:** After multiple attempts, **the agent did not succeed in producing a CI failure**. PR #118 (final attempt modifying an existing code file to include `assert True`) likewise showed all checks passing. The agent left this PR open as instructed for future analysis. The key learnings were that **CI lint checks have hidden config nuances** that the agent must account for: line-length is ignored and low-severity Bandit issues are not considered failures. This experience highlighted the need for alternative ways to generate a controlled CI failure (and the need to better understand CI config).

## Local Bandit Hook Failure (Pre-Commit Configuration Quirk)

During the above experiment, the agent encountered a repeatable issue with the local pre-commit hook for Bandit. The hook is configured to run `bandit -r . -s B101` (recursively scan the repo, skipping rule B101). When committing changes that introduce new files, the pre-commit framework passes the filenames as arguments to Bandit **in addition to** the `-r .` flag. This led Bandit to throw an error about “unrecognized arguments” (the filenames). In essence, **the combination of `-r .` with file-specific arguments is invalid for Bandit’s CLI**, causing the hook to fail every time on new files. The agent had to use `--no-verify` (skipping hooks) to commit changes that would normally trigger this misconfigured hook. This is a known configuration issue: Bandit’s hook should either let pre-commit supply files (without `-r`) or run on the entire repo (with `-r .`) *without* file args. The agent has flagged this as an area for improvement, but it is primarily a development environment hiccup (it does not affect the CI outcome, since CI runs Bandit independently in its workflow). Still, resolving this would enable the agent to catch certain issues locally rather than only in CI.

## Updated Risks & Limitations

The Run 2 experiments revealed **new mismatches between local and CI linting behavior** that could confuse the autonomous agent. We document these below:

* **CI–Lint Config Mismatch (Flake8 E501):** The agent may attempt to enforce or test a style rule (line length) locally that the CI ignores, leading to false expectations. In our case, flake8 rule E501 is ignored in CI (via pre-commit config), so an agent expecting CI to fail on a long line will be misled. This inconsistency is a risk for the agent’s reasoning about what constitutes a “failing” change.
* **Bandit Low-Severity Issues Not Flagged:** Certain security linter findings (Bandit) are not treated as failures in CI. The CI job runs Bandit with severity level “medium”, ignoring low-severity issues like B101 (use of assert). Thus, the agent’s attempt to trigger a failure with a known low-severity issue had no effect. The agent needs to be aware that **a “passing” CI does not guarantee absence of low-severity warnings**, and that not all warnings are equal.

These discoveries will guide adjustments in experiment design and agent strategy (e.g. picking a genuinely failing condition that CI considers critical). They also underscore the importance of **synchronizing local pre-commit checks with CI checks** so the agent isn’t working with two different standards.

## Revised Priorities and Next Steps

The core priorities from Run 1 remain valid – particularly, improving the agent’s ability to detect and handle failing checks is paramount. Run 2 made progress on the detection part (fixing pager issues) but highlighted a gap in **actually generating a failure scenario** for the agent to react to. To address this, we propose an immediate new experiment:

* **New Experiment Set 2-5b – CI Failure via Failing Test:** Rather than relying on linters, introduce a straightforward failing condition in code. For example, add a new unit test `tests/test_fail.py` with an `assert False` that will cause the test suite to fail. This should reliably produce a failing check (the CI test job) that the agent can observe. The agent will create a PR with this failing test and use `gh pr checks` (and/or `gh api /check-runs`) to confirm detection of the failure, capturing the failed check’s name and URL. This experiment will validate end-to-end that the agent can notice a red CI status and record which check failed – a critical step toward autonomous remediation or decision-making not to merge.

Additionally, the agent should investigate the **CI configuration drift** identified in Run 2:

* **Experiment Set 3-10 – Align/Investigate Lint Config:** We recommend adding a planned experiment to review and adjust the repository’s linting configuration. The agent should examine `.github/workflows` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to fully understand which checks are enforced. If certain rules (like E501 or B101) are desired to be enforced, the configuration should be updated accordingly (or the agent at least needs to be aware of what is and isn’t enforced). This experiment would involve the agent diagnosing the discrepancy (which it partly did in Run 2) and possibly making a pull request to adjust settings (for example, removing E501 from the ignore list, or lowering the Bandit severity threshold in CI) and then observing if that causes the intended failures.

Moving forward, the **experiment priority order** remains largely the same (focus on CI failure handling, then expand to re-run logic and PR metadata). However, the *immediate next step* is to execute the new **2-5b failing test scenario**, as it fills a crucial gap from Run 2. Successfully completing that will unlock the originally planned Experiments 8 and 9 (re-running failed checks, and handling protected branch merge refusal) with greater confidence that the agent can recognize a failing status on its own.

Ultimately, Run 2’s findings refine our approach: we now better understand the environment quirks (pager, lint rules) and can tailor upcoming experiments to ensure the agent isn’t thrown off by hidden configurations. By incorporating these adjustments, we will improve the agent’s robustness and move closer to a fully autonomous development cycle.
